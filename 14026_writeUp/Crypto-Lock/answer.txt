From the code, I came to know that I had to decrypt the file <secret.docx.enc> to <secret.docx>. As it was an AES encryption, I needed the key to decode the file. In the key function, <seed> was being assigned value equal to <timestamp>. So, I found the time of creation of <secret.docx.enc>(as this was the time the code was run). So, I bruteforced the key around the time of creation of <secret.docx.enc> and used this key and <decrypt()> function to decrypt the file. Inside the <secret.docx> file, there was the flag. The script I used was <try.py>.
